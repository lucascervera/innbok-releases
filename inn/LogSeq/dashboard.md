	- Create an isometric representation of a startup's business model modeled in clay. The figure should be simple and stylized, with defined features and bright colors. The figures are hand-made with play dough in shades of blue, red, and green. The objects should be recognizable and appear hand-made, showcasing the characteristic texture of clay. The lighting should be soft and even, and the figure should be centered against a white background. The image figures are connected by clay arrows, and all of them converge in a big dollar sign ($). The image should be 1920x1080. On the left side, it mainly has blue clay figures, in the center mainly red, and on the right mainly green. Use these emojis: 🔑🏢✈️💊🛍️⚙️📐💰✂️🙋💎🎙️💸😐📣🎯👤🛒🚨🧪💭💡🪪🔧🗓️🎩🗄️🖥️📓📘🤖🛎️.
