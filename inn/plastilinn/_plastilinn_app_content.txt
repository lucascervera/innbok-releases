innBoK\artifacts\profile-(id)___quantified-value-proposition___examples___Space X.md
          - It is widely recognized that Space X's reusable rocket technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space.
           By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to decrease launch costs by eliminating the need to build new rockets for each mission.
           This approach has already demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional expendable rockets.
           Let's consider a scenario where a traditional expendable rocket launch costs $100 million for a specific payload.
           Now, imagine that Space X's reusable rocket technology allows for a cost reduction of 30% per launch due to the reuse of the rocket's first stage.
           In this example, if Space X were to launch the same payload using their reusable rocket system, the cost savings would amount to $30 million per launch.
           This significant reduction in launch costs can have a substantial impact on the overall budget of space agencies, allowing for more frequent launches, additional missions, or the allocation of resources to other critical areas.

  - ### #[[goal]]
    - #goal [[Build a business based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement]]
  - ### Description
    - Lean Startup is a methodology developed by Eric Ries that aims to build businesses in a more efficient and effective way. It is based on the principles of iterative product development, validated learning, and continuous improvement. The Lean Startup approach emphasizes the importance of testing assumptions, gathering feedback from customers, and making data-driven decisions. By following this methodology, startups can reduce the risk of failure and increase their chances of success.
  - ### Key principles
    - #### Iterative product development
      - Instead of spending a long time developing a product or service in isolation, the Lean Startup approach encourages startups to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and quickly release it to the market. This allows for early feedback and iteration based on real-world usage.
    - #### Validated learning
      - The Lean Startup methodology emphasizes the importance of learning from customer feedback and data. Startups should focus on validating their assumptions and hypotheses through experiments and measurements. This helps to reduce uncertainty and make informed decisions.
    - #### Continuous improvement
      - The Lean Startup approach encourages startups to continuously improve their products, services, and business models based on feedback and data. This involves regularly testing and iterating on ideas, and being open to pivoting or changing direction if necessary.
  - ### Key activities
    - #### Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
      - The core of the Lean Startup methodology is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Startups should build a minimum viable product, measure its performance and customer feedback, and learn from the results. This feedback loop helps to validate assumptions, identify improvements, and guide the next iteration.
    - #### Validated learning through experiments
      - Startups should conduct experiments to test their assumptions and gather data. These experiments can take various forms, such as problem interviews, solution interviews, A___B testing, or pilot programs. The goal is to validate or invalidate hypotheses and make data-driven decisions.
    - #### Pivot or persevere
      - Based on the insights gained from experiments and validated learning, startups should be willing to pivot or persevere. If the data suggests that the current approach is not working, startups should be open to changing direction or exploring new opportunities. Conversely, if the data supports the current approach, startups should persevere and double down on their efforts.
  - ### Benefits
    - The Lean Startup methodology offers several benefits for startups, including:
      -   - Reducing the risk of failure by validating assumptions and hypotheses early on
      -   - Saving time and resources by focusing on building a minimum viable product and iterating based on feedback
      -   - Increasing the chances of success by making data-driven decisions and continuously improving the product or service
      -   - Building a strong understanding of the target market and customer needs through validated learning
      -   - Creating a culture of experimentation and innovation within the startup
  - ### Challenges
    - Implementing the Lean Startup methodology can also present challenges for startups, including:
      -   - Balancing the need for speed and iteration with the need for quality and reliability
      -   - Overcoming resistance to change and embracing a culture of experimentation
      -   - Managing limited resources and prioritizing experiments and improvements
      -   - Dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in the early stages of the startup
      -   - Maintaining focus and avoiding the temptation to chase multiple ideas or opportunities simultaneously

  - The company behind the Vein Viewer, an innovative medical device, developed a business model that focuses on addressing the medical needs of patients and the clinical workforce.
   The Vein Viewer is designed to locate veins in patients, especially in cases where it's challenging due to obesity or other factors. This is known as difficult venous access (DVA).
   The device is particularly useful in reducing the pain and complications that patients experience during needle sticks for vascular access.
   One of the significant innovations of the Vein Viewer is its high-definition imaging and advanced digital full field technology.
   It uses a reflective, infrared technology, emitting harmless LED light, which is absorbed by the blood and reflected by surrounding tissues.
   This technology allows medical professionals to easily locate veins, understanding the patient's blood pattern up to 15 mm deep, with 10 mm being sufficient for medical purposes.
   It prevents patients from receiving accidental punctures during attempts to find veins and projects an image of the patient’s vasculature with exact anatomical locations.
   This not only ensures a safer procedure of vascular access for patients and healthcare workers but also represents a significant advancement in medical science.
   For the business model, the company used the Business Model Canvas as a tool for launching the Vein Viewer Flex to the market.
   The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that provides a visual framework for developing, describing, and analyzing a company's business model, including key partners, activities, resources, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams.
   This tool was chosen for its capability to manage multiple aspects of model development in a well-structured manner​1​.


innBoK\artifacts\my-business___examples___extinguished animals meat.md
  The company uses biotechnology and genetic engineering to revive extinct animals and sell their meat in the luxury food market. The business model is based on several key components:

Research and development: The company invests in scientific research and technological development to understand and manipulate the DNA of extinct animals. They employ biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques to reconstruct the genomes of these species and recreate their distinctive characteristics.

Cloning and reproduction: Once the complete genome of an extinct animal has been obtained, the company uses cloning and assisted reproduction techniques to create living individuals of the species. This involves transferring the reconstructed DNA to stem cells or eggs of related living animals, such as elephants or cows, to produce embryos that are then implanted into surrogate females for gestation.

Care and maintenance: The company establishes facilities and care centers to house and breed the revived extinct animals. They employ veterinary and biology specialists to ensure that the animals are well taken care of and provided with an appropriate environment for their development.

Production and marketing of luxury meat: Once the animals have reached maturity, the company proceeds with meat production. The animals are ethically and respectfully slaughtered following established standards. The meat is processed, packaged with high-quality standards, and then marketed in the luxury food market. The company focuses on attracting consumers willing to pay a premium price for an exclusive and unique gastronomic experience.

Marketing and sales: The company implements marketing strategies to promote the story and value of its products, highlighting its innovative and sustainable approach. They use selective sales channels, such as high-end restaurants and specialized stores, to reach their target audience.

Sustainability and regulation: The company is committed to operating sustainably and ethically. They collaborate with experts in biodiversity conservation and work closely with regulatory authorities to ensure that their activities comply with all legal and ethical regulations related to biotechnology and genetic engineering.

It's important to note that the viability and acceptance of this business model may be subject to ethical, environmental, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, the commercialization of meat from extinct species raises challenges and ethical issues related to biodiversity conservation and respect for animal life.

          - It is widely recognized that Space X's reusable rocket technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space.
           By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to decrease launch costs by eliminating the need to build new rockets for each mission.
           This approach has already demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional expendable rockets.
           Let's consider a scenario where a traditional expendable rocket launch costs $100 million for a specific payload.
           Now, imagine that Space X's reusable rocket technology allows for a cost reduction of 30% per launch due to the reuse of the rocket's first stage.
           In this example, if Space X were to launch the same payload using their reusable rocket system, the cost savings would amount to $30 million per launch.
           This significant reduction in launch costs can have a substantial impact on the overall budget of space agencies, allowing for more frequent launches, additional missions, or the allocation of resources to other critical areas.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Identify the risks.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Una vez diseñado el modelo de negocio candidato, nos centraremos en tratar de identificar los motivos que puedan dar al traste con el proyecto empresarial. Por ello es muy importante identificar los riesgos, de forma que me permita saber por dónde empezar a desarrollar mi proyecto.Para identificar las hipótesis contenidas en nuestro modelo de negocio, una vez hayamos realizado la versión inicial del lienzo de negocio, daremos un paso atrás para verlo con perspectiva, y nos haremos la siguiente pregunta:¿Qué estoy suponiendo que es cierto para que pueda funcionar este negocio?Casi todos los post-it que tengamos en el modelo de negocio llevarán implícita una o varias hipótesis.Por ejemplo si estoy pensando en crear un periódico en el que los contenidos van a ser generados por voluntarios a cambio de obtener visibilidad como profesionales, lo consideraré una hipótesis, ya que puede suceder que no les resulte una propuesta interesante.El grado de riesgo asociado a cada hipótesis dependerá del en gran medida del conocimiento que tenga del mercado al que me dirijo. No es lo mismo que la hipótesis anterior sea planteada por un profesional que ha sido alto ejecutivo de periódicos durante 20 años y que luego a desarrollado una carrera como consultor con durante 15, a que la plantee un estudiante de 2º de Bellas Artes. Obviamente hay mucha más incertidumbre en este segundo caso.Lo que plantea Steve Blank es identificar a nuestros clientes potenciales, salir a la calle e interactuar con ellos a través de conversaciones, entrevistas, encuestas, etc... para validar que lo que tenemos en la cabeza, y estamos suponiendo que piensan, es efectivamente correcto.Es absolutamente normal que varias de las hipótesis que tenemos acerca de nuestro público objetivo resulten no ser ciertas y haya que cambiar el modelo de negocio. Si el cambio es moderado y se trata de ajuste, fino lo realizaremos con facilidad. Pero si alguna de las hipótesis principales de nuestro modelo de negocio resulta no ser cierta, entonces tendremos que pivotar , es decir, aplicar un cambio sustancial al modelo de negocio o, incluso, descartarlo.Descartar a tiempo un proyecto empresarial puede considerarse un “éxito con minúsculas”, ya que se ha empleado poco tiempo y recursos para comprobar que esa idea no va a ningún sitio. El emprendedor no debe contemplar este escenario como trágico, ya que muchas veces solamente los conocimientos generados y la experiencia acumulada al intentar poner en marcha un negocio justifican con creces el esfuerzo, tiempo e ilusión empleados.Hay que ser conscientes de que lo que de verdad es un fracaso es intentar poner en marcha durante un año un proyecto que no va a ningún lado, y que hubiera sido posible descartar en caso de haber aplicado correctamente el desarrollo de clientes.Todas las hipótesis que encontremos llevan asociados riesgos, ya que si resultan no ser ciertas, es bastante probable que nuestro modelo de negocio no funcione.Una de las formas de desperdicio de tiempo dinero y esfuerzo principales en un proyecto emprendedor es la incorrecta priorización de tareas. Comenzaremos por definir dos conceptos importantes:<ul><li>incertidumbre: es la falta de certeza total, es decir la existencia de más de una posibilidad</li></ul><li>riesgo: un estado de incertidumbre donde algunas de las posibilidades suponen consecuencias indeseables</li></ul>Una vez identificados los riesgos es necesario cuantificarlos para entender el impacto potencial que pueden tener en nuestro negocio. Para cuantificarlos se tendrán en cuenta dos aspectos:<ul><li>La probabilidad de que suceda</li></ul><li>Las pérdidas que generaría en caso de que suceda (tanto en términos de costes reales como de costes de oportunidad)</li></ul> Durante el análisis de los riesgos del modelo de negocio intentaré establecer:<ul><li>Estrategias de mitigación, es decir pensar de qué formas puedo eliminar esos riesgos. Generalmente esto lo conseguiremos diseñando y ejecutando experimentos.</li></ul><li>Estrategias de contingencia, que consisten en planificar lo que voy hacer en caso de que un riesgo no se pueda mitigar y tenga lugar. Por ejemplo, esto sucede en los riesgos asociados a la posible reacción de la competencia. Hay siempre un riesgo asociado a que la competencia esté trabajando en un proyecto similar al mío y lo ponga en marcha en un futuro con más recursos y con un punto de partida más ventajoso. Esto sería un riesgo que es muy difícil de mitigar, ya que generalmente no podremos obtener información acerca de este tipo de proyectos, y lo que tengo que hacer es construir una estrategia de contingencia para saber cómo reaccionar en caso de que esto suceda.</li></ul>

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Validation - Risk classification.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Steve Blank plantea que existen dos tipos de riesgo a la hora de poner en marcha un proyecto empresarial:<ul><li>El primero es el riesgo técnico, qué consiste en no ser capaz de desarrollar un producto o servicio debido a la complejidad técnica del mismo. Un ejemplo de empresas que tienen un riesgo técnico muy alto son los laboratorios farmacéuticos que ponen en marcha programas para sacar al mercado nuevas moléculas, pero que se basan en proyectos de investigación que pueden dar resultados o no.</li></ul><li>El otro riesgo es el riesgo de mercado, qué es el de no encontrar suficientes clientes como para sostener mi negocio, que los mismos no estén dispuestos a pagar un precio suficiente como para que yo pueda operar en rentabilidad, o que no seamos capaces de encontrar los canales adecuados para llegar a un número suficiente de clientes a un coste razonable.</li></ul>Steve Blank se plantea: si en la mayor parte de proyectos empresariales el riesgo de mercado es muy superior al riesgo técnico ¿porque los emprendedores se empeñan primero en desarrollar el producto y mitigar el riesgo técnico antes de intentar mitigar el riesgo de mercado?Los riesgos en general se pueden clasificar en tres categorías:<ul><li>Riesgo de producto: lo que él ha asociado a conseguir el producto correcto.</li></ul><li>Riesgo de clientes: el asociada a conseguir llegar a los clientes.</li><li>Riesgo de mercado: el asociado a construir un negocio viable.</li></ul>Existe alguna a ver una serie de riesgos que son habituales y comunes en cualquier empresa que se ponga en marcha y en concreto en las startups. Generalmente es recomendable, sobre todo en la etapa inicial de un negocio, centrarse en los riesgos de mercado, que son los que de forma más habitual suponen el fracaso de una start-up.

- ### Es muy importante salir del edificio cuanto antes y contrastar la idea de negocio con gente distinta a ti mismo. Por lo general tu modelo de negocio candidato se puede contrastar con dos tipos de personas:<ul><li>Tus clientes potenciales</li></ul><li>Personas que conozcan bien a tus clientes potenciales</li></ul>En una etapa inicial tiene más sentido empezar a contrastar el modelo de negocio con personas que conozcan bien a tus clientes potenciales, que además puedes convertir en asesores de forma más o menos formal para que te ayuden a lo largo del proyecto. Un buen asesor te puede ayudar a identificar riesgos que no hayas tenido en cuenta y entender mejor, en función del feedback que te aporte, las posibilidades de éxito de cada uno de los modelos de negocio potenciales.Algunas de las mejores prácticas para llevar a cabo estas entrevistas iniciales son las siguientes:

- ### Lo que te digan tus consejeros o clientes potenciales son sólo opiniones, que además muchas veces seran contradictorias entre sí. Uno de los peores errores que puede cometer un emprendedor es tratar de aplicar todos los consejos que ha recibido. Las opiniones son sólo un conjunto de ideas que le vienen a la cabeza a los entrevistados sin pasar ningún filtro, y es responsabilidad del emprendedor destilar a aquellas útiles de aquellas que no lo son. Hay que tener siempre en cuenta que muchos de los consejos se emiten después de haber descrito el proyecto al entrevistado en un par de minutos. Muchas veces (especialmente si el proyecto es complejo y todavía no lo explicamos muy bien) es posible que la capacidad de nuestro interlocutor para entender de qué le hablamos sea similar a la de Justin Bieber para entender la Teoría del Entrelazamiento Cuántico si se la explicamos gesticulando. Seguramente sus consejos serían distintos si se conocieran más en profundidad los detalles del negocio.

Aún así es una buena idea intentar contar con alguien externo que te ayude con sus opiniones acerca del trabajo que vas haciendo, como puede ser un asesor o un emprendedor que conozcas.En general para poder llevar a cabo la fase de validación del problema y la solución deberás tener en el equipo o emprendedor cubiertas las siguientes habilidades:<ul><li>Alguien capaz de ir desarrollando el producto</li></ul><li>Alguien que sepa de diseño y experiencia de usuario</li><li>Alguien que sepa de marketing y comunicación</li></ul>No suele ser una buena idea subcontratar estos perfiles en esta fase del ciclo de vida de la empresa, ya que es necesario tener visión de conjunto y una involucración a nivel de negocio más allá de la función específica asignada. Además son numerosísimas las experiencias de emprendedores en las que subcontratar estos servicios ha supuesto un dolor de cabeza y unos gastos considerables, sin obtener el resultado esperado. Nunca un proveedor externo se va a tomar tan en serio su trabajo como tú y hay que tener en cuenta que no es el único trabajo que están haciendo, y es habitual que no se cumplan las fechas de entrega.

Cuando hagas referencia, por ejemplo, al tamaño del mercado, no digas que el mercado es enorme, sino que el mercado está compuesto por más de 25 millones de personas (y justifícalo con referencias).

Se trata de convertir las hipótesis que hemos incluido en el modelo de negocio (en las cajas segmentos de clientes y problema) en hipótesis falsables, es decir que una vez ejecutado el experimento resulten verdaderas o falsas.

- ### El terreno previo al ajuste producto mercado está lleno de aprendizaje cualitativo. Puedes mitigar los riesgos en alguna medida, pero no se pueden eliminar del todo en esta fase. Aunque los primeros experimentos suelen ser bastante deprimentes para los emprendedores, hay que intentar no pivotar como un pollo sin cabeza.El objetivo más importante de una start-up en esta etapa es conseguir el ajuste producto-mercado, que no se trata de construir el producto correcto sino de construir un modelo de negocio que funciona y es escalable.Hay que intentar maximizar el aprendizaje obtenido por unidad de tiempo acerca de los riesgos más importantes. El punto inicial es un diseño de un modelo de negocio, que creemos que, en caso de resultar ciertas todas las hipótesis que en él incluyo, tal vez me permita crear un negocio rentable. Para ello, poco a poco, iré llevando a cabo experimentos que van validando los diferentes componentes de cada una de las cajas del modelo de negocio.Los primeros experimentos irán dirigidos a entender el problema en profundidad. Llevaremos a cabo entrevistas con clientes potenciales, y aplicaremos técnicas de observación para entender si el problema que intentamos solucionar es un problema que merezca la pena intentar solucionar. Entre otros aspectos deberemos entender cómo de severo es el problema, si el cliente es consciente de que tiene ese problema y si está dispuesto a actuar para resolver ese problema. También deberemos entender cómo solucionan el problema a día de hoy. Y también intentaremos obtener información acerca de que segmentos de cliente sufren con más intensidad ese problema.En una siguiente etapa, a partir del conocimiento generado en la etapa previa, definiremos la solución, construiremos una demo que ayude al cliente a visualizar y entender en qué consiste la misma, y la testearemos con los clientes. En esta etapa tengo que conseguir entender si la solución funciona y si los clientes perciben que soluciona su problema de forma eficiente. También deberemos identificar quiénes van a ser nuestros early-adopters.La siguiente etapa consiste en validar cualitativamente. Deberé construir un Producto Mínimo Viable y hacer un lanzamiento suave entre los early-adopters. En esta etapa trataremos de determinar si entienden y valoran la propuesta de valor. También es importante ir creando una base de early-adopters que me vayan ayudando a validar el producto a medida que lo voy evolucionando.La última etapa consiste en verificar cuantitativamente .Lanzaré el producto evolucionado a partir del conocimiento generado previamente a una audiencia mayor. El objetivo de esta etapa es entender si hemos construido algo que verdaderamente la gente necesita. También es muy importante empezar entendiendo cómo voy a conseguir clientes de forma escalable y si voy a poder realmente crear un negocio viable.Desde el punto de vista de los riesgos está primera fase me ayudará a:Riesgo de producto<ul><li>crear el producto adecuado</li></ul><li>asegurar que tenemos identificado un problema que merece la pena solucionar</li><li>definir la solución más pequeña posible (Producto Mínimo Viable)</li><li>construir el Producto Mínimo Viable que me permita hacer una demostración de la propuesta de valor</li><li>verificar todo ello de de forma que escale</li></ul>Riesgo de clientes<ul><li>construir un camino a los clientes</li></ul><li>identificar quién tiene el dolor</li><li>identificar quiénes son los early-adopters que necesitan mi producto ahora</li><li>llegar a los primeros clientes a través de canales outbound.</li><li>ir construyendo gradualmente canales inbound (cuanto antes mejor)</li></ul>Riesgo de mercado<ul><li>identificar la competencia y las posibles alternativas y elegir un precio para mi solución</li></ul><li>definir los precios viendo lo que dicen los clientes sobre ellos</li><li>testear los precios viendo lo que hacen los clientes</li><li>optimizar la estructura de costes para que funcione el modelo de negocio</li></ul>

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___No surveys or focus groups.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Para diseñar una encuesta se supone que tienes que saber las preguntas que debes hacer, pero en las primeras etapas del ciclo de vida de una empresa esto no es así, sino que el objetivo de las primeras encuestas es explorar aquello “que no se que no se”. No sólo es probable que no sepa todavía las preguntas adecuadas, sino que tampoco se cuales son las respuestas adecuadas, lo cual me llevaría a que la mayor parte de las respuestas acaben en apartados como 'otros'.Por ello la mejor forma de empezar es con conversaciones desestructuradas y preguntas abiertas.Es muy importante además interactuar con los clientes de forma directa y es algo que deben hacer en persona los fundadores, ya que estas interacciones dan mucha más información a través de los gestos y lenguaje no verbal de los clientes. Como dice Reid Hoffman, fundador de LinkedIn, 'no puedes intuir que un negocio va a funcionar hasta que no ves las pupilas de un cliente potencial dilatarse'.Siempre es preferible que las entrevistas sean cara a cara, ya que como hemos comentado el lenguaje no verbal puede ayudarnos a sacar muchas conclusiones útiles. Además facilitará que las personas entrevistadas empaticen con los emprendedores y le sigan ayudando más adelante.Los focus groups tampoco son una buena idea, ya que generan un entorno muy artificial que no invita a pensar fuera de la caja.Aunque las encuestas no son muy útiles en el aprendizaje inicial, pueden ser muy efectivas para verificar lo que ha aprendido a través de las entrevistas de los clientes. Tras llevar a cabo la validación cualitativa con las entrevistas entonces sí podré articular y diseñar un formulario que me ayude a verificar cuantitativamente el aprendizaje que obtenido y las hipótesis que incluyo en mi modelo de negocio. El objetivo no es tanto aprender cosas nuevas como demostrar la escalabilidad de los de las conclusiones a las que llegado.El principio de salir del edificio que propone Steve Blank, es una práctica, que aunque parezca sencilla en un principio, es difícil de ejecutar correctamente. Muchas veces de forma inconsciente nos cuesta hablar con los clientes. Creo que tiene mucho que ver con que somos conscientes de que podemos llevarnos una decepción. En el fondo es bastante parecido a ligar. Además muchas veces las primeras entrevistas no parecen productivas.Es muy importante entender que los resultados de las entrevistas no siempre son objetivos. Para empezar mucha gente miente, o directamente contesta lo primero que le pase por la cabeza, aunque no sepa que está diciendo. De igual forma, hay gente que no contará todo lo que le pasa por la cabeza para no dar un disgusto al emprendedor que tiene delante con los ojos inyectados en ilusión. También existe todo lo contrario, gente que desde el primer momento intentará sacar todo lo malo que le venga a la cabeza y gozará viéndote tragar saliva.Una cosa importante que seguramente descubriremos es que muchas veces, si se plantea un argumento lógico por el cual un cliente debe comprar un producto, es posible que te digan que, efectivamente, lo comprarían, aunque es bien sabido que los consumidores no siempre se comportan de forma racional ni mucho menos.Una vez entendemos el problema y la solución es importante empezar a medir que hacen los clientes y cómo se comportan. Por ejemplo, si un cliente declara que un problema es muy relevante para él, intenta indagar más, por ejemplo preguntándole cómo resuelve el problema día de hoy. Si no está resolviendo el problema de alguna manera, seguramente el problema no sea tan grave como declara. Si en cambio está solucionando el problema con el producto de un competidor con el que no está contento, o de alguna forma que hay inventado el, puede ser una señal de que el problema merece la pena ser resuelto.Otra táctica interesante es hacer una llamada a la acción. Si un cliente declara que pagaría un precio determinado por un producto, invítale a que pague una reserva del producto por ejemplo. Que se moje. Como dicen los anglosajones: “put your money where your mouth is”.También es importante ser el disciplinado y llevar a cabo las entrevistas de forma ordenada, sobre todo a medida que vamos pasando de generar conocimiento a verificar las conclusiones.Aunque lo más eficiente es identificar un segmento de early-adopters, no es mala idea entrevistar también otros segmentos de clientes. A veces uno se lleva sorpresa. Unos emprendedores con los que hablé, que vendían comida preparada por internet, descubrieron casualmente que sus early-adopters podían ser adultos con padres mayores que se pasaban la tarde del domingo cocinando en casa de sus padres, en vez de paseando con ellos. Una buena idea es empezar las entrevistas de clientes con gente que conozcas. Esto te ayudará a entrenar y mejorar la forma en que puedes llevar a cabo estas entrevistas, además de conseguir que esas personas conocidas que puedan poner en contacto con más clientes potenciales a los que puedas entrevistar.Otra buena idea es, siempre que sea posible, llevar a cabo las entrevistas en equipo, es decir más de una persona, simplemente por el hecho de que a nosotros se nos puede pasar cosas por alto detalles que sean relevantes.Un aspecto importante es intentar que las entrevistas tengan lugar en un sitio neutral como una cafetería. Esto facilita que el tono de la entrevista sea más casual y ayuda a empatizar con el emprendedor. La misma entrevista en una cafetería o en una sala de reuniones de una oficina, es muy distinta. En cuanto a duración de las entrevistas, suelen durar entre 15 y 30 minutos.Si es posible, las entrevistas deberán ser presenciales. Si no es posible, o si es más cómodo para el entrevistado, se pueden hacer en remoto mediante videoconferencia, por ejemplo con Google Hangouts o skype.No es buena idea pagar porque entrevistas, ya que lo que estamos intentando validar es el interés de nuestro público objetivo, y esto se distorsiona obviamente si hay un incentivo económico. Por ejemplo, si me pagaran lo suficiente, yo estaría dispuesto a decir que me parece una buena idea vender dispensadores de caramelos PEZ con la cara de Justin Bieber.No tiene sentido grabar las entrevistas, aunque en un primer momento pueda parecer muy lógico. En realidad no vas a tener tiempo de escucharlas una segunda vez, y además puede que los entrevistados se sientan en poco menos libres en sus comentarios.En cuanto termine la entrevista es una buena idea documentar las conclusiones de la misma sin que pase demasiado tiempo. Suele ser suficiente llevar a cabo entrevistas con entorno a 50 personas en el primer mes. Es útil hacer entrevistas hasta el momento en el que uno se da cuenta de que no aprenden nada nuevo. Es decir cuando tus predicciones sobre las respuestas y comentarios que van a tener son acertadas a priori. Es decir, cuando te sientas como Phil en el Día de La Marmota de Punxstawnwey.Si las entrevistas se conciertan de antemano de antemano, es importante pensar en el proceso a seguir para organizar las mismas sin volverse loco gestionando la agenda.

- ### Lo ideal es encontrar clientes potenciales a los que entrevistar a través de un canal que me pueda servir para obtener clientes en un futuro, pero no siempre es posible. Por ello hay que aprovechar cualquier canal disponible para conseguir estos potenciales entrevistados, aunque no sea óptimo ni escalable.Puedes comenzar con tus contactos de primer grado, es decir con personas a las que conozcas de forma directa, que estén dentro del segmento de clientes al que te diriges. Los resultados de las entrevistas que se llevan a cabo con personas conocidas deben ser interpretados con prudencia, ya que existe la posibilidad de que sean sesgados debido a la relación previa existente ¿De verdad crees que tu madre te va a decir que tu proyecto de vender figuritas de anime hechas con manzanas esculpidas es una estupidez?También hay que pedirles que te presenten a personas que conozcan y que respondan al perfil que estás buscando. Es buena idea ponérselo fácil con un correo que puedan reenviar, o un mensaje de facebook o whatsapp.No tengas reparo en pedir entrevistas a gente que no conoces. Si te presentas como un emprendedor que tiene una idea de negocio y que está intentando validar que tiene sentido antes de lanzarse al barro, generalmente la gente empatiza contigo y va a querer ayudarte. A mi me ha funcionado en múltiples ocasiones en las que no hubiera apostado un céntimo a que me iban a prestar la más mínima atención.Otra forma buena de conseguir clientes potenciales que entrevistar, es creando, cuanto antes, un sitio web que refleje la propuesta de valor e incluya un formulario para que puedan dejar sus datos de contacto las personas interesadas.Una buena forma de romper el hielo también es generando un contenido que motive a la persona a dedicar tiempo a interactuar contigo. Por ejemplo si tu proyecto va dirigido a diseñadores de moda, puedes abrir un blog en el que el incluyes entrevistas por videoconferencia a diseñadores, con lo cual la propuesta que les haces es que les quieres entrevistar y además les estarías muy agradecido si te pudieran dedicar unos minutos posteriormente para la entrevista de validación.Empieza cuanto antes a llevar a cabo entrevistas. Un error habitual es sobre trabajar las entrevistas y posponerlas hasta que todo esté perfectamente organizado. Muchas veces este comportamiento responde al miedo de salir a hablar con clientes y es una forma de autoengañarse.Haz pruebas rápidas de contactar dientes por diferentes canales que se te ocurran. Dedica una mañana intenta contactarles por e-mail, otra distinta a intentar contactarles con una llamada en frío, otra distinta a intentar contactarles a través de LinkedIn y otra a través de Twitter. Mide todo para ver cuál es la forma más eficiente de contactar a tus clientes potenciales.Lo mejor es hacer una lista de clientes potenciales y ordenarla en función de lo importantes que sean para ti. Una vez tengas ordenada lista empieza a contactar a los clientes potenciales menos atractivos y vete sacando conclusiones para ir mejorando este proceso de contacto (y practicando tus habilidades de comunicación) de forma que cuando llegues a los más importantes hayas aprendido la mejor forma de plantear la invitación a la entrevista.

Pero también es cierto que algunas otras veces ayuda a invalidar o validar hipótesis de forma rotunda, por ejemplo si todos los entrevistados que pertenecen al segmento de clientes te dicen que no pagarían el precio que has fijado para el producto.

Es muy habitual que un emprendedor creé un proyecto que resuelve una necesidad que él sufren de forma especialmente intensa, y que proyecte esa necesidad en un mercado amplísimo que en realidad no la tiene.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Instead of talking to clients, I am going to create the product..md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### El estado de la tecnología hace que muchas de las ideas que pueda tener un emprendedor sean muy fáciles y sencillas de implementar en muy poco tiempo, por lo que parece lógico realizar un pequeño esfuerzo en construirlo directamente, para ver luego si se vende o no. Muchas veces los emprendedores se basan en argumentos como éste, porque en realidad lo más estimulante es empezar a construir el producto, lo cual está bien si quieres aprender o practicar un nuevo lenguaje de programación por ejemplo, pero no es lo más inteligente si lo que quieres crear es un negocio. Por ejemplo, para tener algo que mostrar a clientes potenciales no hace falta que que esté funcionando una aplicación, sino que generalmente es suficiente con algunos diseños de pantallas.

- ### En ocasiones hay problemas que claramente tiene sentido resolver (por ejemplo una enfermedad grave, o aumentar las ventas de una empresa), por lo que no es necesario llevar a cabo tantas entrevistas de clientes. En estos casos lo que nos pueden brindar las entrevistas a los clientes potenciales, es entender en profundidad los matices del problema e identificar cómo perciben ese problema los distintos segmentos de clientes.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___If I conduct customer interviews, they will steal the idea..md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En un primer momento las entrevistas se centran en el problema, por lo que no tienes porque dar demasiadas pistas acerca de cómo piensa solucionarlo. Además si estás entrevistando a tus público objetivo es mucho más probable que muestren más interés en adquirir tu solución una vez esté disponible, que en montar una empresa para copiarte. Por otro lado, lamento comunicarte que es, cuanto menos, poco probable que seas el elegido por un ser superior para otorgarte una idea de que vaya a cambiar el destino de la humanidad. Lo más probable es que esa misma idea la hayan tenido ya otras muchas personas.

Es una buena práctica someter los documentos asociados a las entrevistas a un **control de versiones** indicando si es la versión 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc... cuando se introduzcan cambios.

Los early-adopters van a usar sus alternativas existentes como un ancla respecto al cual van a juzgar tu solución, precio, y posicionamiento.

- ### En cuanto pongas la demo delante de los primeros clientes a los que realices las entrevistas de solución, vas a sacar conclusiones muy rápidamente, que deberás incorporar a la demo y probar en las entrevistas siguientes. Es por ello que no suele ser una buena idea subcontratar la construcción de la demo, si no aprender a realizarla tu mismo. Aunque no estés familiarizado con las herramientas necesarias para construir tu demo, puedes aprender rápidamente a utilizarlas.

- ### La creación de una demo conlleva un esfuerzo en coste y dinero que no deja de ser un desperdicio, en el sentido en que muchas veces no se incorpora al producto final.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Test the price (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### En muchas ocasiones, en las entrevistas de solución, si les preguntes a los clientes acerca del precio que estarían dispuestos a pagar, no tendrán la más mínima idea. Y además se sentirán incómodos. Es difícil convencer a un cliente de que tiene un problema, pero a menudo es posible convencerles de que paguen un precio por el producto.Hay que evitar una reacción muy natural en los emprendedores, de rebajar los precios para disminuir la fricción del comienzo del uso. Es muy habitual que queramos hacer tan fácil como sea posible que los clientes digan si a nuestro producto y comiencen a usarlo, esperando que el valor que les entregamos a lo largo del tiempo les convenza de pagar un precio determinado. Esta es una estrategia muy peligrosa ya que retrasa la verdadera validación del negocio. Uno de los aspectos más importantes a validar es el compromiso de los clientes con el producto.Recuerda que tu objetivo es encontrar early-adopters que sean apasionados de tu producto y que estén dispuestos a pagar un precio justo. Recordemos que el precio no es sólo parte de nuestro producto, sino que además define el segmento de clientes al que nos dirigimos.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Do not decrease friction, increase it (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Soy consciente de que esto puede ser contra intuitivo, pero si has llevado a cabo correctamente el análisis del problema, podrás justificar por qué tiene sentido económico para ellos el precio de tu solución. Esto te ayudará a identificar aquellos clientes que sienten el problema de forma más severa. Aunque a veces nos cuesta un poco creer creérnoslo a nosotros mismos, tenemos que hacer ver a los clientes que participar en una etapa temprana de nuestro producto como early-adopters es una oportunidad, lo que significa darle la vuelta al típico discurso de venta.Una de las estrategias que puedes seguir es hacer ver que hay una escasez para participar en esta fase como cliente. Puedes comunicar claramente que no estás tratando en este momento de vender el mal el máximo número de unidades posibles, sino de encontrar los 10 clientes que más se ajusten al perfil de lo que estás buscando, para darles una especial atención e incorporar su feedback al producto.

Cuando tenemos hijos hacemos muchas fotos constantemente, al igual que videos. También tenemos solicitudes frecuentes de los abuelos y otros miembros de la familia para que compartamos con ellos estas fotos y videos. El proceso de compartir estas fotos y vdeos es demasiado intensivo en tiempo. Tenemos que organizar los ficheros, editarlos y estar presentes durante el proceso de subida al al servidor que utilicemos. Con el video, a veces tenemos que convertirlo otros formatos. Si a esto sumamos que como padres tenemos menos tiempo que antes de tener hijos y valoramos mucho más nuestro tiempo libre, preferiríamos emplear nuestro tiempo en otras cosas. ¿Te suena estos esta situación?”Lo lógico sería que a la mayor parte de las personas a las que entrevistes en entrevistas de solución reconozcan que efectivamente es un problema que tienen. Si no fuera así, tal vez deberíamos volver a pensar si estamos resolviendo un problema adecuado.

En este caso podemos hacer dos cosas:<ul><li>Plantearle el precio de forma directamente y analizar su respuesta y si lo acepta si lo ve claro o si ha tenido dudas.</li></ul><li>Preguntarle tres precios: el que considera adecuado para la solución, el precio a partir del cual consideraría caro el producto, y el precio a partir del cual consideraría barato el producto.</li></ul>

Humaniza todo lo que sea posible la misma y aporta datos del equipo fundador: fotos, enlaces a los perfiles de LinkedIn, etc. No caigas en el error de hacer una página “sobre nosotros” acomplejada y anodina. Digo acomplejada porque es frecuente encontrarse con páginas de startups que son un quiero y no puedo, y utilizan un lenguaje imitando al de las grandes corporaciones: ' somos una empresa joven y dinámica pero de sobrada experiencia cuyo objetivo es superar de forma constante las expectativas de nuestros clientes ofreciendo soluciones integrales blablablá'.

Esto siempre es preferible a otros medios como correo electrónico, foros o paneles de discusión.Detalles, como contactar a los clientes proactivamente para interesarse por el uso que están haciendo de tu producto, contratar un número ofrecer un número gratuito de contacto telefónico, demuestran a los clientes que te preocupas por ellos.

- ### Permitir a un cliente probar tu producto antes de comprarlo, y siempre que puedas hacerlo en función del tipo de producto servicio vendes, es una buena idea. No sólo supone una forma de generar clientes de pago, sino también una fuente excelente de aprendizajeEl primer objetivo de las pruebas de clientes, es reducir la tasa de abandono en la adquisición y activación. El siguiente objetivo es incrementar la retención y el enganche, conseguir pagos (si aplica), y obtener testimonios de clientes favorables.El objetivo debería ser conseguir que un porcentaje notable de mis early-adoptpers complete el ciclo. Ash Maurya plantea que sea el 80%. El mundo es de los valientes. En cualquier caso lo importante es entender que este porcentaje será muy superior al que tengamos en la cabeza cuando el negocio esté funcionando a velocidad de crucero, ya que, con todas las ocasiones en las que has hablado con ellos, esperemos que hayas sido capaz de generar un interés especial

Hasta el tipo más aburrido del mundo tiene de vez en cuando cosas que hacer y se distrae, y un recordatorio te puede ayudar a que dirija de nuevo su atención a tu producto.En realidad más que enviar correos en función del tiempo que ha pasado desde que el usuario se ha registrado, es mejor pensar que correos le vas enviar en función del la etapa ciclo de vida en el que se encuentra. Por ejemplo si un usuario se estanca en la fase de activación, en vez de enviarle información acerca de las características super avanzadas de tu producto, tiene más sentido que le envíes una guía de problemas frecuentes.

innBoK\topics\topic___Validation___Solution interviews___Learn and pivot (Solution interviews).md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### Pivotar es la acción de introducir algún cambio relevante en el modelo de negocio, generalmente como consecuencia de qué alguna hipótesis importante no ha sido validada y ha probado no ser cierta en un experimento..

En ocasiones el alcance el cambio es limitado y se puede considerar que el negocio que continúa es el mismo, y en ocasiones el cambio es totalmente radical e implica dirigirse a nuevos clientes resolviendo un problema totalmente distinto con una solución que se parece como un huevo a una castaña a la inicialmente pensada..

Es muy habitual que un pivote sea consecuencia de que una startup ha creado su modelo de negocio inicial tratando de ofrecer una solución universal para todos los problemas del mundo, pero que en algún momento se han dado cuenta de que, si quieren tener éxito, lo que tienen que hacer es ser los mejores haciendo una sola cosa muy bien..

Algunos ejemplos de startup que han pivotado pueden ser:.

Instagram, la conocida aplicación para compartir fotos a través del móvil, que antes de convertirse en lo que son ahora eran una especie de Foursquare que geolocalizaba a los clientes y les permitía hacer check-in en sitios a los que entraban..

Otro ejemplo de pivote es el que lleva a cabo YouTube, que antes de convertirse en la plataforma de vídeo online de facto en Internet, comenzó siendo una página para encontrar pareja a través de videos..

PayPal comenzó siendo un proyecto que permitía intercambiar dinero a través de las Palm Pilot, hasta que Peter Thiel, uno de sus fundadores, vio mucho más potencial en resolver un problema mucho más grande: la necesidad de disponer de una forma fácil de transferir dinero online..

Flickr es otro ejemplo the startup que pivotó. Al principio comenzó siendo un juego de rol online hasta que se dieron cuenta de que era mucho más interesante solucionar el problema de encontrar una forma fácil para compartir fotos en Internet..

Groupon por ejemplo empezó siendo una plataforma de activismo ciudadano.

Shopify empezó siendo una tienda online para aficionados al snowboard, pero cuando descubrieron lo complicado que era crear una web de comercio electrónico decidieron escribir su plataforma propia y ofrecerla como solución a empresas pequeñas que tuvieran el mismo problema.

Twitter surgió de la empresa Odeo, que era un directorio de podcasts que dejó de tener sentido cuando salió iTunes, y decidieron centrarse en el desarrollo de Twitter, un side project que convirtieron en su producto principal..

Esto ayuda a evitar percepciones erróneas en el equipo acerca de la solución que estamos creando.

Si estamos cenando un software o sitio web describiremos los flujos de usuario entre una pantalla y otra, si se trata de hardware puede servir un diagrama, etc...

No se debe entrar en detalles de bajo nivel y distraerse demasiado en este paso.

Intenta ser prudente con las cifras, ya que si no perderás credibilidad. Intenta prometer menos menos y entregar más.

Se trata de validar que se ha encontrado una oportunidad escalable no una solución para un cliente.

Disminuir la incertidumbre y estaremos más confiados en que el negocio es viable.

Contacta con cada uno y preséntales tu caso de uso del ciclo de vida completo, la especificación de alto nivel del producto y la propuesta de valor cuantificada. Recuerda que estás en modo investigación y no modo ventas.

En algunos casos se les puede pedir que firme en una carta de intenciones, o incluso pagar una pre-reserva.

No se deben sacar conclusiones de entrevistas individuales, sino identificar patrones.

Si no eres capaz de conseguir 10 potenciales clientes, es una posible señal de que debes cambiar tu mercado desembarco.

Es habitual que en una decisión de compra esté involucrada más de una persona, por lo que es importante entender el rol de cada uno de ellos y sus intereses.

Ya tenemos cierto nivel de confianza en que nuestra persona de usuario final va a obtener valor de nuestro producto y que nuestra oferta es única, y ahora nos centraremos en validar que nuestra persona de usuario final y nuestros 10 siguientes clientes puedan comprar nuestro producto.

Es más habitual en ventas B2B que haya más gente involucrada que en ventas B2C.

Analiza cuáles serían los mercados de seguimiento una vez hayas dominado el mercado desembarco y calcula su tamaño.

Se trata de un chequeo para entender que vamos en la dirección correcta y que el negocio es escalable.

Hay dos tipos de mercados de seguimiento: 1, Upselling consiste en vender otros productos o servicios a los mismos clientes aprovechando las relaciones y canales que tenemos con ellos. 2, Mercados adyacentes, que suelen requerir funcionalidades adicionales o cambios en el producto pero que se construyen sobre el nuestra esencia.

Se le debería dedicar en torno a una décima parte de lo que se dedicó a calcular el TAM del mercado desembarco.

Usaremos la propuesta de valor cuantificada y el modelo de negocio para generar la primera versión de la estructura de precios.

La estructura de precios puede tener un impacto gigante en los resultados de la empresa.

Hay que preveer que pueda cambiar el la estructura de precios.

Definir la estructura de precios nos permitirá calcular el valor del ciclo de vida del cliente, que junto con el coste de adquisición de cliente, me permitirá entender la rentabilidad de mi negocio.

Hay límites en lo alto que se puedan poner los precios relacionados con la Unidad de Toma de Decisiones el proceso para conseguir un cliente que pague y el ciclo de ventas.

Siempre hay una tensión entre conseguir ingresar tanto como sea posible y conseguir el número mayor de clientes que sea posible.

innBoK\topics\topic___D-eship___d-eship step___16 determina tu política de precios___Cómo establecer un precio de para mí producto.md
page-type:: [[topic]]
- ### El coste no debe ser un factor a la hora de establecer los precios.

Hay que pensar cómo se reparte el valor generado entre el cliente y nosotros. Un punto de referencia es quedarnos con el 20% del valor generado. Depende también del riesgo que esté asumiendo el cliente al comprar nuestro producto.

No compartas tus cifras de costes con nadie que no las necesite.

Utiliza la Unidad Económica de Decisión y el Proceso para adquirir un cliente que pague para identificar los puntos de referencia de precios. Entiende los precios de las alternativas que tiene el cliente.

Diferentes tipos de clientes pagarán diferentes precios. Por ejemplo, los perfiles marcados por la curva de adopción de las innovaciones.

Se flexible con los precios para los primeros probadores del producto. Siempre es más fácil bajar el precio que subirlo.
