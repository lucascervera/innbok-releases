						- #### #artifact [[life time value]]
							- The lifetime value of a customer refers to the net present value of the total revenue a customer will generate over their relationship with a business. For Space X, the lifetime value of a customer could be calculated based on factors such as:
								- Revenue from satellite communication services: Space X's Starlink project aims to provide global internet coverage through a satellite network. The lifetime value of a customer could be determined by estimating the revenue generated from the subscription fees paid by customers for accessing the internet services.
								- Revenue from launch services: Space X offers launch services to customers for deploying their payloads into space. The lifetime value of a customer could be calculated based on the revenue generated from multiple launches and the frequency of their usage of Space X's launch services.
								- Revenue from spacecraft manufacturing: Space X manufactures spacecraft, such as the Dragon spacecraft, for crewed and uncrewed missions. The lifetime value of a customer could be determined by estimating the revenue generated from multiple spacecraft orders placed by the customer.
								- Revenue from satellite deployment services: Space X provides satellite deployment services for customers who want to deploy their own satellites into space. The lifetime value of a customer could be calculated based on the revenue generated from multiple satellite deployment missions carried out for the customer.
								- Revenue from other services: Space X may offer additional services, such as research and development collaborations or consulting services, to customers. The lifetime value of a customer could include the revenue generated from these additional services.
							- To calculate the lifetime value of a customer, the revenue generated from the customer over their relationship with Space X would be discounted to its present value using an appropriate discount rate. This would take into account the time value of money and the uncertainty of future cash flows. The resulting net present value would represent the lifetime value of the customer to Space X.

						- #### #artifact profile [[profile (id)]] [[quantified value proposition]]
							- It is widely recognized that Space X's reusable rocket technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space.
							- By recovering and reusing rocket boosters, Space X aims to decrease launch costs by eliminating the need to build new rockets for each mission.
							- This approach has already demonstrated cost savings compared to traditional expendable rockets.
							- Let's consider a scenario where a traditional expendable rocket launch costs $100 million for a specific payload.
							- Now, imagine that Space X's reusable rocket technology allows for a cost reduction of 30% per launch due to the reuse of the rocket's first stage.
							- In this example, if Space X were to launch the same payload using their reusable rocket system, the cost savings would amount to $30 million per launch.
							- This significant reduction in launch costs can have a substantial impact on the overall budget of space agencies, allowing for more frequent launches, additional missions, or the allocation of resources to other critical areas.

						- #experiment [[Vertical Integration]]
							- Space X adopted a vertically integrated approach, aiming to have control over key components and technologies in-house. By designing and manufacturing a majority of the rocket components themselves, Space X sought to reduce dependence on external suppliers, improve quality control, and accelerate innovation.
						- #experiment [[Rocket Engine Development]]
							- Space X recognized the importance of reliable and cost-effective rocket engines. To reduce the risk associated with engine development, the company embarked on the ambitious task of designing and manufacturing its engines. This led to the development of the Merlin rocket engine, which powered the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets.
						- #experiment [[Rocket Reusability]]
							- Recognizing the high cost of expendable rockets, Space X embarked on an experimental journey to develop reusable rocket technology. The company conducted various experiments and tests to land and recover rocket boosters after launch. These experiments resulted in significant advancements, leading to the successful recovery and reuse of Falcon 9 first stages.
						- #experiment [[Failure and Learning Culture]]
							- Space X adopted a culture that embraced failures as learning opportunities. The company understood that failures were an inherent part of pushing the boundaries of space exploration and technological innovation. Space X actively learned from failures, iterated on designs and processes, and implemented corrective measures to improve future missions.
						- #experiment [[Commercial Cargo and Crew Programs]]
							- Space X pursued contracts with NASA under the Commercial Cargo and Crew Programs. These programs provided an opportunity for Space X to demonstrate its capabilities and reliability in delivering cargo and eventually crew to the International Space Station. The partnerships with NASA helped Space X refine its processes and gain valuable experience in managing complex missions.

					- #### #artifact [[AI business description]]
					   Space X is a pioneering aerospace company founded by Elon Musk with the vision of revolutionizing space technology and enabling the colonization of Mars. The company's business model is centered around developing and manufacturing advanced rockets and spacecraft, as well as providing launch services to customers around the world.
					   One of the key aspects of Space X's business model is its focus on reusability. Unlike traditional space agencies and companies, Space X aims to recover and reuse as much of its launch hardware as possible. This is achieved through the development of advanced technologies like the Falcon 9 rocket, which is designed to land vertically after delivering its payload to space. By reusing rockets, Space X is able to significantly reduce the cost of space travel, making it more accessible for both commercial and scientific purposes.
					   Another important element of Space X's business model is its commitment to innovation and pushing the boundaries of space technology. The company is constantly working on developing new and more advanced rockets and spacecraft, such as the Starship, which is intended to be fully reusable and capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. Space X also invests in research and development to improve the efficiency and performance of its space vehicles.
					   In addition to its commercial launch services, Space X also generates revenue through partnerships with government agencies, such as NASA, to provide cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station. The company has also ventured into satellite deployment with its Starlink project, aiming to create a global satellite internet network that can provide high-speed internet access to even the most remote areas of the planet.
					   Overall, Space X's business model revolves around developing innovative and reusable space technology, providing launch services, and exploring new frontiers in space exploration. Through its ambitious goals and commitment to technological advancement, Space X is reshaping the space industry and paving the way for a future where humans can become a multi-planetary species.
