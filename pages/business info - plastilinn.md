								- - #risk [[Technology Obsolescence]]
								- - The rapid pace of technological advancements in the business design industry may lead to the risk of technology obsolescence. InnMoDeler must continuously adapt and incorporate new technologies to remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of its users. Failure to do so may result in a loss of market share and relevance.
								- - #risk [[Data Security Breach]]
								- - As InnMoDeler stores user data in plain text files, there is a risk of data security breaches. Unauthorized access to sensitive business model information can lead to reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and potential legal consequences. Implementing robust security measures and regularly updating security protocols is crucial to mitigate this risk.
								- - #risk [[Dependency on Open-Source Software]]
								- - InnMoDeler is built on Logseq, an open-source tool. Dependency on open-source software introduces the risk of limited control over updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
