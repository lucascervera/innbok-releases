- ## #info 
a hypothesis refers to a proposed explanation or assumption about a specific aspect of the business. It is a statement that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between certain variables or factors within the business model. Hypotheses are often formulated in order to test and validate assumptions, identify potential risks, and guide decision-making processes. By testing these hypotheses through experimentation or data analysis, businesses can gain insights and make informed decisions to improve their business model.
